I recently set up a scalable and highly available architecture using:

ðŸ”¸ 2 EC2 Instances running Apache web servers
ðŸ”¸ Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic
ðŸ”¸ Target Group with health checks
ðŸ”¸ Public subnet configuration with open port 80

 Each server serves a different HTML page, and the ALB ensures seamless switching and uptime â€” a solid step toward mastering cloud infrastructure and HA systems.

Hereâ€™s the architecture diagram I followed ðŸ‘‡
